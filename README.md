My primary aim to create one streamlit application where I provide swagger json url and data source ( primarily sql database ) with multiple tables which will be used to set up data  in the jmeter script created. Also on the streamlit I will have 3 parameter one for swagger url , one for datasource connectivity and mapping and other one for prompt chat window where I will provide the command and based on my prompt , swagger url , datasource details , respective jmeter scipt will be created. Let me know if you are clear with my requirement . if you are not , let me know. I want dummy swagger +sql database pair which are publicly avaialable to test this .
